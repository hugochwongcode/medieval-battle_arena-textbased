## Game Overview
The game allows players to choose from a selection of characters, each with different attributes such as health, attack, defense, and weapon. Players then enter a battle arena where they face off against randomly generated enemies. The objective is to defeat the enemy before the player's character's health reaches zero.

Arena Selection: A battle arena is randomly selected for the player to enter. Each arena has a different difficulty level.
Battle: The player's character engages in battle with a randomly generated enemy. Attacks and defenses are calculated based on the characters' attributes and weapons.
Outcome: The battle continues until either the player's character or the enemy's health reaches zero. The player is notified of the outcome (victory or defeat).

## Additional Features
Randomization: Enemies and battle arenas are randomly generated to provide variety in gameplay.
Countdown: A countdown timer adds suspense before the start of each battle.
Error Handling: The game includes error handling to ensure valid input from the player.
